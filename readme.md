# Introduction

This project with product name Easy Rent web app is a Grazaz Academy live project app assigned to group of interns to develop.

This web app is to serve as a bridge between seekers of apratments to rent and their owners. The major goal is for potential apartment seekers to rent an apartment with ease and even avoid the unneccesary high agent fees.

We want to accomplish a situation where seekers can be like "oh wow, these guys made this extremely easy to find great apartments with no agent fees and no stress.

We strongly value excellence in terms of apartment search, navigation and user experience on the app platform and our sole mission is just to curb people going through stress of agents and yet still paying high fees.
